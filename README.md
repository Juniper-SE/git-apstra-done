# git-apstra-done
This is a demo of how to integrate git with apstra to achieve ci-cd

To use the project, you will need the following
- An internet-accessible Apstra, such as the one in Apstra Cloud Labs https://cloudlabs.apstra.com
- A terraform cloud account to set up a Terraform Cloud Instance https://app.terraform.io
